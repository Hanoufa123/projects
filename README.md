Project Portfolio

Welcome to my personal project space. This folder contains a variety of technical projects I've built, explored, or deployed

Each subfolder represents a standalone project.

Feel free to explore each folder. Most projects include:
- `README.md` with setup instructions
- `requirements.txt` for dependencies
- Source code and configuration files


> This folder is a living archiveâ€”updated as I learn, build, and refine. Dive in and explore.
